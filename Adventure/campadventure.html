This summer, a small group of junior high boys led by a Scout leader appear at Institute amongst the throngs of high school students. Little more thought is given to them until the following year, when the Scout leader fails to return. Eager to retain the boys, the Institute calls on Edgar Moore, the former captain of cadets in DePauw University's Department of Military Science and Tactics, to create and run programming for the boys. This quickly leads to the establishment of Boyville, and Moore Hall is built within the next few years to accomodate them. A Girlville for junior high girls is established not long after. Though not as immediately populous as the Institute, these programs do well for several years and are eventually given their own homes at Epworth. In 1941, Boyville and Girlville are combined to form Camp Adventure, and the girls are permanently housed in Pell Lodge after it is constructed in 1943. </p>"

In a post-war world and with rather aging facilities, the camp is trying to figure out what its identity should be going forward and how to plan to get there. The Foundation Board Study Committee decides to call together a two-day meeting for all those interested in planning Epworth's future. At the meeting, several different opinions emerge: some want Epworth to remain more rustic, some want it to be turned into a carnival of sorts, and others want Epworth to be made more comfortable and a separate, more rustic site purchased for junior high campers. When this last option was proposed, apparently the witty Dr. George Greer commented, \"This is the way it goes. You start out with a rustic camp grounds. Then you improve this and that and something else until it gets so fine that some other people come along with a proposal for a rustic camp grounds. Then the process begins all over again.\" It is three years, however, before the Study Committee feels ready to draw together specific proposals. The committee finally requests $2000 at the 1956 Annual Conference to formulate a Master Plan. </p>"

The plan calls for raising over a million dollars, making it by far the largest campaign by the conference to that date. One of the biggest decisions made by the plan is to separate Institute and rustic camping by purchasing a new campsite. The committee emphasizes that the property should follow the American Camping Association's standard of having one acre per camper; they also prefer the site be close to Epworth for administration purposes. </p>"
                    +"<p> By 1958, the housing situation has become dire. On top of a booming Institute, nine weeks of Camp Adventure are being offered, which only adds to the overcrowding problem. This leads, at last, to the purchase of additional property in 1958. Forty acres a half mile north of Epworth are purchased for $17,000. The land, quickly dubbed Epworth Hills, is described as \"hilly, half of it heavily wooded, and a small lake touched the north line.\" Despite the acreage not meeting the one acre per camper standard, the 40 acres looked really good compared to the crowded conditions at Epworth, and the buyers hoped the lake could be developed to be good for boating and swimming. Around this time, the State is also purchasing the land surrounding the property and developing it into a Fish and Game Recreation Area, so the campers would also have access to this acreage to hike and study nature. The Foundation promptly recommends that developing this site become first priority in carrying out the Master Plan. </p>"

Apparently the Department of Conservation is resentful that the Conference has purchased the ground at a higher price than the Department was allowed to pay. Thus, they build a fence through the lake at the property line, making boating and swimming impossible. Furthermore, hunting occurring in late summer poses significant danger to campers. These disadvantages, combined with the relatively small acreage, begin to make the Foundation Board very nervous. Even after letters are exchanged with the Department of Conservation and the relationship between the Department and Foundation is seemingly improved, there is still a lot of unease around developing the property. Thus, the search begins again for a home for Camp Adventure.</p>"

The property is about one-third solid ground and has 3-4 islands with lots of swamp land in between. On March 20, the Master Plan Committee votes to buy the farm as a home for Camp Adventure, and it is named Epworth Heights; eventually the Camp Adventure program becomes synonymous with the grounds, and the grounds become known as such. A group of about 20 people, with a fair number of high school and college students, host a work camp that summer to help prepare the grounds. The team lives in the old farm house, which has no indoor plumbing, and work on building a causeway to Oak Island, planting trees, and demolishing the barn. A two-day work camp is also held in the fall, and more trees are planted, a road is built across the swamp to the big island, and the marshy valley on the east side of Lookout Lodge is ditched and made into a sports field. It is during the course of this project that the workers come across a skeleton. It is sent off to the state for proper identification and is eventually reported to be a Native American man who died over a hundred year prior. Based on a bullet wound found in his pelvis and the fact that he was found facedown, authorities surmise that he had been riding horseback, was shot off his horse, and landed facedown in the swamp, where he died. </p>"

The 1972 journal states that this purchase \"opens exciting new possibilities for Junior High program,\" but it does not elaborate what plans are for the property. There does appear to be a bit of a staffing problem; the journal notes that the use of Kaiser Lake was \"handicapped\" when the camp could not find waterfront staff to run activities. The following year, a leadership training camp is hosted at the camp to help train \"all leaders of camping,\" and it is stated that \"The quality of our junior high experience is dependent on the counselor. Our staff makes positive Christian growth effective, or unlikely.\" Other notable happenings around this time include the first baseball camp, which is held in 1976 for 5th-8th graders and is deemed a success. </p>"

The building committee recommends that the campaign be extended for one more year in order to meet its five remaining goals, which include handicap ramps and facilities at all camps, a project each at Lakewood, Pine Creek, and Epworth, and the payment of the loan from the Conference. </p>" 
                    + "<p>The funds massed from the campaign extension are enough to complete a few more projects, including apparently a new septic tank and leach field at Adventure; however, the Campaign is still disappointed with the lack of pledges made. Over the course of the next couple years, handicap sidewalks are installed, and the camp heating system is installed. There is also mention of a ropes course in use, though it does not say whether this is a high or low ropes course. </p>"
