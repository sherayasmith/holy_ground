A special session of the Northwest Indiana Conference is held in West Lafayette on January 3, 1956 to discuss the findings of a study done on camping over the last 19 months. While it is noted that \"Battle Ground has played a wonderful part in the history of our conference,\" it is also stated that \"the fire hazard, close proximity to the town, the memorial park, and the lack of ground for camping make our present location undesirable today.\" Thus, remodeling, renovating, or adding new buildings at Battle Ground is not considered a favorable plan, and the search has begun for other potential sites. The Committee to Study the Long-Range Use and Program of Battle Ground prioritizes qualities such as potential for development of a lake in their seach and finds a 232-acre site just oustide of Pine Village. The site is described as being half wooded and half cleared with a stream running through it that could be dammed up. The lay of the land would allow one site each for Intermediate Camp, Junior Camp, and a High School Institute to be developed without interference between them. The land is being offered at $100 an acre, and an option to buy has been given to the Conference until January 15. State Soil Conservation engineers have been consulted with and deem the property suitable for a lake, so the Committee recommends that funds be borrowed immediately to secure the property, and an asking of $28,000 is distributed among the churches. The Conference then votes to enter into a contract to purchase the property with plans to fully own it by March 1.</p>"

Of this amount, $200,000 is going to a dormitory and dining room at Pine Creek with the rest going to Epworth Forest. By the following year, however, the Committee has shifted its focus dramatically. Instead of camping being just one of five items on the budget, the campaign has been dedicated entirely to funding improvements to the camps, and the plan has now been opened up to all five sites.
