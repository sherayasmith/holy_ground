While technically the nationwide merger of the Evangelical Church and the United Brethren Church had occurred in 1946, union in Indiana was not really complete until the conferences were redrawn in 1951. 1951 also brought the donation of some 92 acres off the shore of Lake of the Woods by a Mr. Elmer Seagly of Kendallville. Before this point, nearly all Evangelical camps and conferences in Indiana had been held at Oakwood Park in Syracuse, and the camping area at Oakwood is now being quickly outgrown. Furthermore, Oakwood is determined to be too modern and developed for the rustic camping popular at this time. A committee is quickly formed to examine the property, and they quickly make the recommendation to accept the property, calling the gift \"very timely.\" </p>"
                    +"<p>By 1953, a joint committee of the Board of Trustees and the Board of Christian Education has been formed to investigate the needs of the property in order to develop it as a camp site. $50,000 is determined to be needed to start development at the camp. A $50,000 fund raising campaign is quickly started for the development of the camp and the improvement of Oakwood, with funds to be divided 4 to 1. The funds for the new site will are planned to go towards \"a road, central lodge, and cluster of cabins accomodating 100 campers.\" The lodge is to contain \"a general assembly room, game and administration rooms, and dining room with facilities.\"  </p>"

Before long, a contract is let for \"the construction of a road and the development of a beach site.\" While this is encouraging, the committee warns that \"the money must be coming this year that we may erect buildings.\" The forward movement cannot be quick enough; apparently Oakwood is overflowing with campers, so Camp Mack, located just a few miles west of Oakwood, is rented to host overflow campers. </p>"
                    +"<p>The $50,000 goal has not been met by Annual Conference in 1955, but progress has been made both in fundraising and camp projects. It is reported that \"over half mile of good gravel road [is] built from the county highway to the camp site; bathing beach constructed on the lake near camp site; electric current brought in to the camp site; three boats bought for the camp... and a well is being drilled.\" The first week of camp is also held this summer, an \"experimental,\" week-long, all boys tent camp. This appears to be a success. It is predicted that campers will likely still be in tents in 1956, but the first floor of the new lodge should be finished by this point, so campers will have some shelter in case of storm. The location of the three cabin clusters, latrines and infirmary \"have definitely been established\" and will be built as funds are made available. </p>"

The camp also gets a huge increase in campers: 6 camps are held with 40 to 60 campers and counselors each. There are but six platform tents to house them all. In terms of facilities, it appears the ground floor of the \"Brownlee log cabin style\" Lodge has been completed and contains \"two large rooms in the South wing, a center area for cooking and dining room and the North wing containing utility room and rest rooms.\" The roof has been left a concrete slab in anticipation of the second floor, which is still to be built as funds are made available. At this point, only $32,000 of the hoped for $50,000 has been raised. </p>"

This floor will have two fireplaces made out of \"rough Indiana limestone.\" The lodge will also have \"an exterior facing of vertical Michigan white cedar half-sawed logs,\" and \"the roof will be surf green asphalt shingle.\" At this point, the camp has a capacity of 288 intermediate campers, though this year campers only number 236. The price of camp for the week is reported to be $17.</p>"

Despite just having received the Lakewood property in 1951, the camping system is struggling to keep up with the huge influx in campers. Thus, the conference makes the decision to purchase another site, 80 acres outside of Wabash, for $5000. Now with three sites to develop and maintain, the conference finds itself a little strapped for cash; thus the Visison for Victory campaign is born. The journals, however, do not state many details, and it appears to be a very open, loose-ended campaign. The final big event this year is dedication of Camp Lakewood, which occurs June 22. Soon afterwards, the camp is handed over to the conference trustees to manage. Lakewood sees several new programs this summer, including an experimental family camp, an invitational camp to \"introduce new persons to our camping program and to enlist new leaders,\" and a retreat for older youth. </p>"

Life at Lakewood seems to go on much like normal; the journal notes a new entrance that bypasses the swamp, some small repairs made to the Lodge, and a tractor purchased for mowing. Land acquisition is deemed a \"pressing need.\" The following year, amidst union, a mobile home is provided for the camp manager and his family, and a small mower, chain saw, and canoes are purchased.

By 1972, sixteen junior camps for elementary campers had been scheduled between Lakewood and Pine Creek. the camp is not strictly for elementary campers at this point, however; the 1972 journal also states, \"The use of the newly developed areas at Lakewood provided a place to base our advanced junior high events, and to allow for the building of Christian relationships, orienting (sic) skills and supplies, and stressing the need for safety in camping.\" Unfortunately, no further details are given as to what the \"newly developed areas\" entail.</p>"

There is also significant need for a stove and dishwahser in order \"to bring our kitchen up to to state requirements;\" this is secured in 1974. The \"Round-O\" tents have apparently failed in staying waterproof, as there are plans to waterproof or replace faulty tent coverings.

Nick Yarde, the new camp manager hired in 1994, has taken this project on and has already begun cutting and curing beams from trees cut on the property to be used in the building. Later journals reveal that Nick himself designed the building after \"an English tithe barn that has been standing for over 700 years.\" The building takes over three years to complete, but once finished contains a kitchen with a walk-in cooler and freezer, a meeting room, and a loft area. With its view overlooking the lake, several people regard it as one of the most beautiful buildings in all of the camps.</p>"
