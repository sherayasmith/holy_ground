Enrollment for Institute reaches 1400 youth, and this figure likely does not represent all the other programs that are happening the same week.

To amend this, they propose \"a major capital funds campaign on the conference level to provide camping and institute sites and facility development for the growing needs of our program.\" Meanwhile, the Board of Trustees recommends razing the Vincennes District House and salvaging any usable materials for the two new winterized cottages about to be built.</p>"

The cottages are wildly popular, so much so that by 1965, the Committee on Camping recommends switching over entirely to small buildings and retiring all the district houses. 1965 is also the year that over 500 acres in Brown County, to become Camp Moneto, is purchased, which will have huge impacts on Rivervale. The Trustees also recommend that the Ben-Anna building, the only building at this point not owned by the Conference, be purchased by the Conference.</p>"
