In terms of administation, there is consideration of building an Education Building on the grounds. Hints of the Great Depression and possibly even the Dust Bowl creep in in 1932, as some become concerned with the amount of dust in the Tabernacle and begin looking for material to lay down on the floor. There are hints of financial hardship also; the journal suggests, \"Fathers and mothers give your boy a dime for every A he receives on his report card this school year and then send him to Camp next June.\" In 1933, it is decided to oil the Tabernacle floor instead of lay any material down, another possible sign of hardship. It is also admitted in the journal that \"there has been no established policy in financing the upkeep and maintenance of the Camp Ground\", which does not bode well for the camp's financial status. A committee is appointed to work out a policy and submit it for approval.</p>"

With its lakefront setting, huge Institute attendance, and large amenities, Epworth would have unquestionably won out between the two camps. The Methodist Protestant Camp was eventually acquired by the Nazarene Church and still operates today as Camp Shiloh. I was unable to find any information about when the Nazarenes purchased the campground and whether anything was made of the camp before then. When I visited in fall of 2019, it appeared that the Tabernacle on the grounds was the original, albeit extensively remodeled; it looks as though the administration building might also be original. The grounds now are certainly larger than 18.5 acres, and modern attractions have been added, such as a small lake and a rock climbing wall. Little now distinguishes it as the former Methodist Protestant Campground. </p>"
