Santa Claus is also to be transferred back to the Evansville District, leaving the Conference with just Indicoso and Moneto.

Some of these funds go towards the Jean F. Kauffman shelter and five smaller shelters in Pioneer Camp, as well as 80 additional acres purchased for $64,000; the reasoning behind the extra acreage follows: to\"(1) protect us from adjacent development, (2) provide long hike and even over-night camp outs, and (3) a possible lake site.\" The journal also reports plans to remodel Takamoke.  </p> "
