In terms of further improvement, the Board of Directors recommends remodelling the Auditorium so that it has \"a chapel in the middle with class rooms on either side and a large recreation room in the east end. The Board of Directors also recommends putting up for sale 29 of the 79 acres purchased in 1928; this particular acreage has been farmed by the conference since purchase, but particularly in recent years has not yielded enough to be worthwhile. The Conference votes to do this.</p> "

With the growth of youth work in the conference, they find that \"our present facilities are inadequate and antiquated,\" and \"to remodel, renovate, or add new buildings at our present location would be ill-advised.\" Reasons for this include \"the fire hazard, close proximity to the town, the memorial park, and lack of ground for camping\", not to mention the cost involved. Thus the committee began searching, particularly for a larger property which did not already have a lake but could support one if developed. They come across 232 acres priced at $100 an acre outside the small town of Pine Village. Prospects for a lake look promising, and the property is such that three separate units could be developed for junior, intermediate and high school camping without them interacting. Thus, the committee recommends carrying forward with purchasing the grounds, and an asking of $28,000 is distributed among the churches.</p> " 
                    + "<p>By 1957, it seems as though the opportunity of buying the Pine Village (later called Pine Creek) site could not have come at a better time; on April 25, 1956, 76 youth were registered for camp that summer, while on April 25, 1957, a whopping 687 youth had been registered. The Board of Education reports that three additional weeks of camp have already been planned, but they are still \"having to disappoint our families because some camps are filled to overflowing more than two months before our summer program begins.\" It is noted that this is a nationwide phenomenon. The newly formed Summer Camp Study Committee is now recommending that both the Pine Creek and Battle Ground sites will be needed to support camping, though it recommends all buildings at Battle Ground should be owned by the Conference in order to more efficiently manage the grounds. Another asking of $25,000, separate from the one for the creation of Pine Creek, is recommended for the removal and renovation of structures at Battle Ground.</p>"
                    +"<p>In 1958, the Camp Study Committee recommends that Battle Ground be used primarily for institute-like programs and weekend retreats. Major changes to the property are imminent, as it is determined that new buildings will cost less than revamping the old, particularly if some good materials can be salvaged from the old. The owners of the 32 privately owned cottages on the grounds have been contacted as to their plans for the cottages, and many are reported as wiling to sell. In the meantime, work is done on the Terre Haute cottage, and a need for deep water lines for cottages being winterized is noted.</p>"

His plans include building \"a large dining hall and recreational building overlooking a campus-like mall to the east and a beautiful stream to the west. There will be a \'Meeting House\' and chapel combined sitting near the present site of the hotel, but facing the mall that approaches the village of Battle Ground. A series of open classrooms and a collonade will make it possible to walk from the recreational building to the chapel in bad weather. The area now occupied by the tabernacle will be given to a wide expanse of lawn beautifully landscaped with flowers and shrubbery.\" Bishop's vision for the property is somewhat modeled after a \"typical Early Indiana Village Community. \" Development of the non-immediate grounds is considered not a priority. Both the auditorium/tabernacle and hotel are to be razed; the tabernacle is said to have never been a \"strong permanent building,\" and the hotel \"has been remodeled so often and inexpertly that the original design is practically lost and the basic structure badly weakened.\" Meanwhile, the camping program is expanded to a total of 36 camps, institutes, retreats and conferences, and attendance is growing so much that the Conference is having to rent other campgrounds outside of Battle Ground and Pine Creek. </p> "

At that time 30 of the 48 are owned by the conference, and by 1961 that number is up to 43. Beginning construction on the new dining hall and recreation center is projected for 1962. 641 juniors, 564 junior highs, 363 senior highs and older youth, and 137 family campers are reported from the 1961 season, and it is noted that this drop in senior high students is a nationwide trend in church camping.</p>"

It is reported that all cottages on the grounds are now conference-owned, and there are plans for each cottage to be studied and either remodeled for winter, fall or summer purposes or dismantled. A new sewage treatment plant is reported as being installed. Little is reported in 1963, except that the sewage system is in operation and that the Battle Ground Committee is working on plans for the use of Capital Funds when they become available.</p>"

First priority of this plan is the purchase of cottages, the construction of a retreat center, and the demolition of the hotel, which appear to have already been accomplished; also first priority is the construction of a new lounge attached to Carpenter Hall, as well as the demolition of the auditorium. In the ideal future layout of the camp, all cottages would be removed; two more retreat centers, four dorms, three summer program units, and an administration building would be built; a new bathhouse would be built next to the pool; Carpenter Lodge would be extensively remodeled; and the entrance would be moved to the south side of the camp. </p>"

It is reported that there is no longer any worry about a proposed off-ramp for the new I-65 cutting throught the property. Current plans are to rebuild the kitchen in Carpenter Hall, erect a new caretaker's residence, and build a shop and storage building. In order to complete the development plan proposed the year before, it is determined that $400,000 beyond the Capital Funds program will need to be raised. There is a desire to finish Battle Ground sooner rather than later.</p>"

The Committee on Camping indicates that it now has funds to develop a second retreat center, and they hope to start work on it the next fall. The motivation behind the second facility is due to the popularity of the first. Apparently little progress is made in this area, as the 1967 Journal reports that a new \"Retreat Center-Assembly Hall\" is going up. </p> "
