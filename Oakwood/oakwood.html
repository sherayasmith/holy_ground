The land is located on the west shore of Lake Wawasee and comes with a wood-frame hotel - located on top of the hill - a barn, an orchard, an oak grove, and an ice-house. Immediately after the grounds are purchased, a \"working bee\" is scheduled in order to prepare for the first camp meeting. </p> "

The land originally belonged to a Pottawatomi tribe, and intermixed with factual accounts about Oakwood are a few ghost stories starring the Native Americans. The property was later purchased by the B&O railroad, which ran through Syracuse; the hotel was originally built to house resorters who came in on the railroad. Unfortunately for the Evangelical Association, these resorters had given the property a poor reputation; the Conference History states that they \"imbibed intoxicants freely with consequent behavior.\" A less reputable source insists that the waitresses serving in the hotel doubled as escorts come nightfall. It is not surprising that the Conference history reports that the church's purchase of the property is \"much appreciated by the civil authorities and the community in general.\""

Program includes prayer meetings, lectures, Bible studies, song fests, and worship sessions; meetings are offered in both English and German. After the camp meeting is finished, the Indiana Branch of the newly formed, denomination-wide Young People's Alliance hosts its convention from August 29-31. On September 1, a special meeting is called, and the terms of the park are announced.

The other big item this year is the construction of the long-awaited new hotel, built along the lakeside. The building is a concrete block structure with thirty rooms, an office, a dining room and kitchen. There is no water in the hotel at first, but this evidently comes later. According to the Centennial History, the hotel is briefly called Hotel Esther after the superintendent's oldest daughter, but the Annual Conference Journals do not ever refer to it as that. The old hotel on the hilltop is used for at least a few more years as the superintendent's home. It is not clear why there was a such a demand for a new hotel, but a combination of factors, such as the old hotel's somewhat seedy past and the appeal of a new hotel on the lakefront, might have contributed.</p>"

The stove was left unattended for a brief time, but unfortunately just long enough for the structure to catch on fire. Regardless of how the fire started, the structure is completely destroyed. Efforts to replace it begin just four days afterwards with a Board of Trustees meeting, where architect Oscar Hoffman is decided upon to draw up plans for the new building. The Trustees are also quick to learn from their mistakes; the following day, a motion to purchase a fire hose and \"two dozen chemical tubes for fire extinguishers\" carries, and a few days later, there is a motion that the new building be roofed with \"red asphalt shingles.\"</p>"

True to his style, the chapel is an octagonal building, albeit much smaller.

                    + "<p>Despite this low number of campers, Oakwood is retained. In 1973, the journal reveals the conference's plan to turn Oakwood into \"the site of Adult events for the Conference\" at the suggestion of Bone, Britten and Wright; this plan seems to make sense, as Oakwood seemed to be moving in that direction before merger. The following year, it is announced that the Commission on Camping, partnered with a special task force, is \"studying the possibiltiy (sic) of a motel construction at Oakwood Park...The possibility of this dream would make increased adult programming at Oakwood a reality\" and allow for \"adequate year-round facilities for a variety of adult programming.\" The committee, now dubbed the Oakwood Park Expansion Committee, makes progress in 1975 and is reported to be \"negotiating directly with the Lily (sic) Foundation for possible funding of a new facility.\" By 1976, $30,000 of Lilly grant money has come through, though the plans have changed to restoring the hotel rather than building a new facility. </p>"
                    +"<p>Perhaps the first recognition of possible conflict between Oakwood and Epworth Forest occurs in 1975, when an Adult Fellowship is held at Oakwood and at Epworth Forest. Apparently, members chose their site based on which they were familiar with, as the journal states, \"There was concern for additional former Methodist participation at Oakwood Park and former EUB participation at Epworth Forest.\" </p>"

On November 5, just after midnight, firemen respond to a fire at Oakwood and find four cottages burning. The fire burns nearly all night, and 100 firemen are called in to help fight the flames, which are fanned by heavy winds. Ultimately seven cottages are destroyed that night. The State Fire Marshall determines that the only possible cause of the fire is arson.</p> "

Future plans for the park at this point include renovating the hotel, relocating the dining room of the hotel, possibly expanding Oakwood Center, upgrading the lodge for extended seasonal use, creating a new entry road south of the current entrance, and maybe building cabins in the orcahrd area. A program director for the park is also hired this year.</p>"

The Board cites reasons for this including a sense that this campaign \"has not had broad based ownership,\" and the fact that Bishop Armstrong, who was a prominent figure within the campaign, abruptly resigned amidst some personal struggles and scandal. This latter has \"necessitated a reassessment of the campaign organization and strategy\", and \"Original time lines have been extended in order to develop new approaches.\" The Board remains optimistic, however, and continues to emphasize the desperate need for a spiritual life center. </p>"

Perhaps the linchpin of the resignation is the \"Conference Council on Finance and Administration's recent action rescinding Oakwood's authorization to conduct a fund raising campaign,\" which has dampened the Board's efforts to revitalize Oakwood. Despite its evident frustration and sadness, the Board notes several positives in programming that occurred under its tenure; just three years prior, the site \"initiated none of its own program,\" yet in 1984, 30 separate events were planned and held at Oakwood, and 54 events were scheduled for 1985 at the time of the Board's resignation. On top of this, over 200 local church retreats and consultations were conducted by Oakwood staff on and off site, and a strong spiritual formation program has been developed. The Park has also notably hosted the Upper Room Prayer and Bible Conference the last few years. The board has also raised $415,000 over the past two years for capital development. </p>"

The total budget for all of this reaches a lofty $2,541,000. Again, a bit of competition between Epworth and Oakwood resurfaces in an FAQ section of the journal, when questions such as what is the difference between the sites and whether they can be combined are presented. The journal does state that the two sites cannot be combined, as Epworth cannot provide summer family ministry as it is already very booked, and Oakwood is not large enough to be able to take on current programs occurring at Epworth. 3549 guests in 1986 are reported for Oakwood, as compared to 8293 guests at Epworth.

The Park finally got its new hotel in 1996 with the help of a donor who poured millions of dollars into the project. This resulted in a very nice, upscale hotel. Problems evolved, however, when conflict over the sale of alcohol arose. Many patrons of such an upscale hotel, including the generous donor, were expecting alcohol to be served, yet the property was still under the control of a Methodist agency, which could not condone the sale of alcohol. Thus, the hotel began to lose business. The upscale hotel also meant raised prices, which many of the United Methodist groups who had previously used Oakwood could now not afford. Thus, the hotel was losing business from both Methodist and non-Methodist patrons. On top of this, the adult education purpose seems to have fallen through. This is Oakwood's approximate situation when the Foundation decides in 2008 that it \"could no longer operate Oakwood Park as an Adult Christian ministry\" and begins to return the property to the Conference, as agreed upon when the Foundation was originally created. </p> " 
                    +"<p> This process is interrupted, however, when the hotel donor files a lawsuit challenging the transfer of Oakwood back to the Conference. According to an article in <i>The Goshen News</i>, he feels that since the conference has \"announced its intention to sell the property and pocket the proceeds,\" his massive contributions will in effect be \"convert[ed]...into a huge cash windfall to the NICUMC.\" He also fears that the sale of the property to private developers \"would represent the death of Oakwood\". The trial takes place in 2010, and the court determines that the Oakwood Foundation Board of Directors acted improperly and directs the Conference to return the property to the Oakwood Foundation. The court also dismisses the Board of Directors and appoints a Receiver to manage the property and seek a buyer. By Annual Conference, the Receiver has found a buyer in the Parent Family, and the conference has approved plans to finalize the sale and repay the conference for costs in maintaining the property. </p>"
