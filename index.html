        <h2>Did you ever go to church camp?</h2>
        <p>Did you spend a week in a cabin with kids you didn't know previously, or a cottage full of your friends from church? Did you enjoy activities such as canoeing, hiking, horseback riding, "blobbing," and rock wall climbing? Did you laugh at silly skits performed by ministers, or videos recorded by staff members? Did you stay up late talking with newfound friends? Did you learn to enjoy camp food? Did you love camp so much that you went back to counsel or staff there? Did you meet God at camp, either for the first time or the hundredth? Did you give your life to Christ at camp? </p>
        <p>Many Hoosier United Methodists can answer yes to most of these questions. For over a century, camp has been a tremendous force in the United Methodist Church and its predecessors in Indiana, exposing children and youth to the gospel in a fun, loving environment and sending them back home with the tools to be a light for Christ. Many of Indiana's United Methodist leaders, pastors, missionaries, and even bishops received their calling into ministry at camp. Because of camp's enormous impacts on the church, this website strives to document their history and share it with the world.  </p>
        <p>This site focuses on twelve United Methodist camps throughout Indiana. Each camp has its own page and a timeline filled with information and media sourced from the Indiana United Methodist Archives at DePauw University, the camps themselves, local libraries, and other former campers. Links to each can be accessed on the right side of this page. As you explore, I highly encourage you to fully interact with the site: click on media and links! Some images lead to entire galleries of photos from that time period.</p>
        <p>If you attended a site that is not one of the twelve documented here, please know that I had to make a very difficult decision on which camps to include considering time constraints. This project will be ongoing, so there's a high chance other sites will eventually be added. If you have additional information or media you'd like to contribute, or if you spot inaccurate information, please don't hesitate to <a href = "mailto:sherayasmith@gmail.com">reach out</a>! Also, if you'd like more information regarding this project and the process involved, please take a look at <a href="SherayaSmithHonorScholarThesis2020.pdf">my project summary paper.</a> </p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
