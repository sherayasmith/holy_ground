This committee then calls together a two-day meeting of all those interested in determining Epworth's path. Some want Epworth to move more towards a carnival grounds for the unchurched, while others wanted \"increasing comfort and convenience\" and still others wanted a more rustic camp. Manifold's account states that at one of these meetings, \"When proposals were made for increasingly comfortable facilities at Epworth Forest and for a rustic camp grounds for junior highs, Dr. George Greer commented, \'This is the way it goes. You start out with a rustic camp grounds. Then you improve this and that and something else until it gets so fine that some other people come along with a proposal for a rustic camp grounds. Then the process begins all over again.\'\" </p>"
                    +"<p>In the meantime, the Board authorizes the construction of two new large cottages northeast of the then ball field for $10,000. These were built to alleviate the housing shortage caused by the sale of several cabins which had previously been rented to Instituters. These cottages were likely some of the first facilities to house both boys and girls in the same building; several precautions were taken, including separate staircases, separate bathrooms, and even double walls between the two dormitories \"to discourage making holes through the walls.\" The downstairs had a kitchen and living room, as well as rooms for the counselors and cooks. Six of these were built between 1953 and 1958, and they were named North Star, Red Wing, Forest Lodge, Nome, Parkview, and Jubilee. </p>" 
                    +"<p> In 1954, the Board votes to purchase 600 Irwin chairs to replace the seats in the auditorium, and another 200-300 are later added. Manifold has much to say about the seats being replaced: \"Every person who attended any activity in Epworth Forest Auditorium during its first twenty-seven years was permanently marked by the ridges of the seats. Fortunately for his memory the name of the designer is not mentioned in Dr. Freeland's account of earlier days,\" and so on. Needless to say, the replacements were much looked forward to. </p>"

This year, the number of junior high camps also increases from 6 to 7. By the 1956 Annual Conference, the Study Committee is ready to begin changes at Epworth and asks for $2000 to prepare a Master Plan. Aerial photographs of the grounds are arranged, and a topographic map is made from the photos.</p>"

The plan calls for raising over a million dollars, making it by far the largest campaign by the conference to that date. One of the biggest decisions made by the plan is to separate Institute and rustic camping by purchasing a new campsite. The committee emphasizes that the property should follow the American Camping Association's standard of having one acre per camper; they also prefer the site be close to Epworth for administration purposes. Other items on the plan include new camp entrances to better separate the program from private residences, new housing units, open air classrooms at Pell Lodge, a new concession building, outdoor amphitheatre, etc. Some smaller changes are made to the grounds this year: a new diving tower is erected, new auditorium doors installed, the Sandy Kay cottage added on to, and the other half of Kline Island purchased. In terms of programming, it appears the choir school is going swimmingly; the journal states that the Choir School's \"Show Boat program has done much to establish closer relationship [sic] between Epworth Forest and the surrounding communities... The Sunday afternoon concert was of the highest quality. We trust that this school will long be a part of our summer program.\"</p>"

It is revealed that only 32 housing units are available each week to house 50-65 churches per district. The journal exclaims, \"Housing becomes evermore a pressing need! It is complicated by the fact that the youth age group becomes larger every summer as \'war babies\' mature.\" The Master Plan Committee thus recommends moving immediately into a finance campaign at Annual Conference, which is approved via vote. The journal also shares that nine weeks of Camp Adventure are now being offered, highlighting the overcrowding problem. Several small changes are made to the property this year, but the biggest development comes when 40 acres located a half mile north of Epworth are purchased as an intended junior high site.\" Epworth also adds programming for elementary students this year; the buildings on Kline's Island are fixed up, and 20 campers eke out a rustic experience on the Island for a week the first year. </p>"

The other big development is the purchase of 110 acres around the backwaters of Lake Webster. The 40 acres purchased north of Epworth in 1958, dubbed \"Epworth Hills,\" is determined by the expansion committee to be too small and rugged for development; it also poses risks such as exposure to hunters during the fall.

The committee's goal was to complete the Master Plan within the next year. Also during this year, the Committee to study Epworth Forest Authority proposes overhauling the Epworth Forest Foundation in order to create an Epworth Forest Board.

Adults plan the agenda; youth do not have freedom for expression.\" Decision night, the longstanding tradition where youth were given the option to dedicate their lives to Christ and ministry on the last night of camp, was long considered the crescendo of the week, but by 1966, several thought it felt artificial and too central. These complaints and concerns contributed heavily to program shifts. Rather than focusing on \"the desire for decisions,\" emphasis is now to be placed on \"Christian experiences and living together.\" Three schools are developed for the Instituters to choose between: Music and Arts, Dialogue with the World, and Youth in Mission.

Camps and conferences make up one of the five items on the list, and under that item five of the six objectives pertain to Epworth. These include $50,000 to renovate the lodges, $200,000 to create a new entry way and roads, $630,000 to build an adult/family conference center, $150,000 to convert Cokesbury to a dining room, and $300,000 to build a multi-purpose building for large gatherings. The journal also notes that a worship caravan has been developed this year as an event designed to train youth in worship. </p>" 
                    +"<p>By the following year, the Capital Funding Commmittee has shifted its focus dramatically. Instead of camping being just one of five items on the budget, the campaign has been dedicated entirely to funding improvements to the camps, and the plan has now been opened up to all five sites. The journal also notes that all fives sites operated with balanced budgets the previous year, and that a study and evaluation of Senior Institute has begun.</p>"

By Annual Conference the following year, projects at Epworth to be funded by Phase 1 of the campaign include the new entry and roads, acoustics in the auditorium, three new conference lodges, the new dining/meeting building, and the new year-round auditorium. Phase II will cover three new dormitory lodges and four more conference lodges. For the next several years, relatively little is mentioned in the conference journals regarding Epworth.

Progress moves quickly: the groundbreaking ceremony for both buildings is held that August, and the 92-year-old auditorium is demolished beginning in September. The new Bishop Mike and Marsha Coyner Discipleship Center is consecrated during Annual Conference in 2017 and is ready for campers by that summer.
