While technically the nationwide merger of the Evangelical Church and the United Brethren Church had occurred in 1946, union in Indiana is not really complete until the conference lines are redrawn to form the Indiana North and Indiana South Conferences in 1951. After this redrawing, the North Conference has Oakwood and is given the Camp Lakewood site that same year, while the South Conference is left with Maple Grove and a 44 acre site outside of Anderson, confusingly named Lakewood Camp. While Maple Grove has long been a part of the Evangelical and United Brethren churches, it is located in the southernmost part of the state and is not well suited for the rustic camping experience becoming more popular. This leaves only the Lakewood site in Anderson. For some unknown reason, however, the Conference suddenly decides to sell the Anderson site in 1952, and in 1953, the Board of Christian Education recommends \"that we continue to look with favor upon the developing of a Central Camp for Indiana Conference South as soon as possible.\" </p>"

In terms of development, a house for the camp manager's family has been erected, refrigerators have been added to the lodge, and the beach area has been resurfaced and a large float built on the lake.

Enough funds from the $1.5 million \"Change a Life, Transform the World\" capital funds campaign have become available that Rivervale has already been granted a new bathhouse and pool and Moneto has purchased an additional 80 extra acres; this leaves Indicoso next on the list. Construction on the dining hall/retreat center begins in the spring of 1998, although it appears that the campaign has slowed down some. To help remedy this, a plan is made to name rooms or objects such as the kitchen, a meeting room, or fireplace, after significant donors; donors donating $10,000 or less will receive a plaque hung in the new center. </p>"

There are plans reported in the works to connect the camp to the municipal sewer system. By the following year, the Board of Trustees has stepped in to fund $372,000 of \"a needed sewer project\" at the camp. It is also mentioned that the Capital Fund Campaign being held at the time, largely to raise money for a new discipleship center at Epworth Forest, will fund \"additional projects\" at Indicoso if funds permit. By 2016, the sewer is being upgraded through connection to the local sewer system, though some concerns from neighbors appears to have slowed things slightly. The system is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, but the 2017 journal reports that it's been delayed \"due to various obstacles.\"</p> "
