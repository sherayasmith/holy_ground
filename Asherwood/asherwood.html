Camp Lakewood, which was given to the conference in 1951 and was intended to be a sort of overflow for Oakwood Park, was already filling to capacity. The Committee on Camp Development realizes this and begins searching for addtional property. At Annual Conference in 1958, it announces the purchase of an \"80 acre wooded tract of land near Richvalley for camping purposes.\" The property cost $5000. Now with three camp properties to develop and maintain, the Conference is slightly strapped financially, so the Vision for Victory campaign is also begun this year. While the Conference Journals do not mention much else regarding this campaign, it appears that it is very loose and open-ended.</p>"
                    +"<p>The following year, the Development Committee apparently still is not convinced the new property will be enough, as the Board of Trustees is authorized to study the advisability of purchasing 80 acres adjacent to the 80 acres already purchased. There are plans for mainly junior high camps to be held there, and 1959 sees the camp's first group, a junior high outpost camp, despite the apparent lack of facilities.</p>"

There are also plans to purchase dining tables and chairs. The journal mentions a pole building, which has improvements made to it this year. In 1965, there are plans for a service road, sanitary facilities, and well for use by Outpost and other camps to be installed. A group of EUB men offer to provide funds for the creation of a pond at Asherwood, and by the following year the pond has been constructed, and the new road developed.

Surprisingly, little regarding Lakewood and Asherwood and the merger is mentioned in the journal; it appears the main concern is making sure the EUB Oakwood Park and the Methodist Epworth Forest can coexist. Life at Asherwood seems to go on much like normal, and expansion continues; the journal notes that a family camp area has been developed, and already a camp with 47 families involved has been held. Interestingly, it is agreed that \"land acquisition is a pressing need at both Lakewood and Asherwood and should be our goal when and as such land becomes available.\" There is also a study begun on \"the necessity of additional building needs at Asherwood.\" Finally, the journal notes some concern for adequate on-site swimming.</p>"

This many properties is decided to be too much for the newborn conference to handle, so the consulting firm Bone, Britten and Wright is called in to help evaluate and make recommendations for each of the sites. Despite having 442 campers in 1969, the third highest of the seven, recommendations come back in 1971 for Asherwood to be sold. While specific reasons are not given, Asherwood is likely chosen due to the grounds' lack of a lake and relative undevelopment; it also lacks the historical nature of some of the other camps, and it was purchased rather donated, like Lakewood was. By 1973, the Marion Community School District has offered to buy Asherwood for $29,000 in hopes of turning it into a nature park. The Conference votes the sale, and despite an anticipated grant falling through, the school system is able to purchase the property in 1975. </p>"
